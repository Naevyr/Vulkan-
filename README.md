# Vulkan+ 

Vulkan+ is a learning project based initially on [This tutorial](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/) made in Vulkan and rust.

Its main purpose is to be a showcase project of all the techniques and concepts in CG/Vulkan. It won't be fully operational nor usable for production. It is still a work in progress.
